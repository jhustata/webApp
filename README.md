# WebApp Project

### Background

- Review [this](https://abikesa.github.io/flow/abikesa_stata.html#nonparametric) page
- Only the nonparametric and semiparametric parts
- Click on the link for [beta](https://abikesa.github.io/flow/_downloads/b57ad99810799d0be5a9e18f54115561/b.csv) coeofficients
- And the link for basecase [survival](https://abikesa.github.io/flow/_downloads/9c26f2afd014707dc60aefc8facbf60d/s0.csv) function

### Methods

- We're going to use the betas and survival function to get the mortality risk at 0, 5, 12, and 15 years in living kidney donors
- Once we've set it up well, we'll then include more complex scenarios than we have now
- For now the scenarios are only three: donor, nondonor, general population

### Results

- Look at the [webApp](https://jhustata.github.io/webApp/) to see that it works. Right now it has a bug
- But the general setup is emerging
- Lets talk about this soon!
